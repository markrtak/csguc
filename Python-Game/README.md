Implement a turn-based game between a human and a computer using three bags, each starting with 10 objects. Players take turns removing 1 to 5 objects from one bag. The human goes first, followed by the computer. The human must provide valid inputs for bag selection and object count. The computer always makes valid moves. The game ends when all bags are empty, and the player who removes the last object wins.
